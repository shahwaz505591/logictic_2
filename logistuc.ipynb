    "Q1. Purpose of Grid Search CV:\n",
    "Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) is a technique used to tune hyperparameters in machine learning models. Hyperparameters are configuration settings for models that are not learned from data but need to be specified before training. The purpose of Grid Search CV is to systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameter values, evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation to find the combination that produces the best results.\n",

    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Hyperparameter Grid: Specify the hyperparameters and the possible values to be tested.\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Divide the dataset into multiple folds and train the model on different combinations of hyperparameters for each fold.\n",
    "Evaluate Performance: Measure the model's performance using a scoring metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) for each set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "Select Best Parameters: Identify the combination of hyperparameters that yielded the best performance across all folds."

    "Q2. Grid Search CV vs. Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV: Exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameters in a predefined grid. It is computationally expensive but guarantees finding the best combination.\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: Randomly samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from a specified distribution. It is less computationally intensive and is useful when the search space is large.\n",
    "Choice between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Grid Search CV when you have a relatively small hyperparameter search space and computational resources are not a major constraint.\n",
    "Use Randomized Search CV when the hyperparameter search space is large, and you want to balance exploration of diverse combinations with computational efficiency."

    "Q3. Data Leakage:\n",
    "Data leakage occurs when information from the test set or unseen data is used to train the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. It can result in inaccurate assessments of a model's generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If the training data is not properly preprocessed, and the mean or standard deviation of a feature is calculated using the entire dataset (including the test set), the model may inadvertently learn information about the test set during training, leading to data leakage.\n",
